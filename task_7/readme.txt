Task 7: SQL Views â€” Simplifying Queries in EdTechDB

Objective:
Learn how to create and use **views** to simplify complex queries and control data access in SQL.

What I Learned

- Views allow you to store SELECT queries as reusable virtual tables
- You can use views to simplify frequently used complex joins
- Views are useful for abstraction (hide unnecessary details)
- Views help with security by limiting access to sensitive columns (like email)

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- DB Browser for SQLite (works with CREATE VIEW too)
- VS Code (SQLTools)
