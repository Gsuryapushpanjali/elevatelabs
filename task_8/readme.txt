Task 8: Reusable SQL — Stored Procedures and Functions in EdTechDB

Objective:
Learn how to create and use **stored procedures** and **functions** to make SQL reusable and modular.

What I Learned

In this task, I:
- Wrote my first **stored procedure** that takes an input parameter
- Built a **user-defined function** to return a calculated label
- Learned how to use `IF` logic inside SQL blocks
- Understood how procedures/functions improve reusability and readability

Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench (with DELIMITER support)
- SQLite doesn’t support full stored procedures — use MySQL instead
