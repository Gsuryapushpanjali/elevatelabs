Task 5: SQL JOINs â€” Connecting Tables in EdTechDB

Objective:
Learn how to retrieve related information from multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations.

What I Learned

In this task, I explored how to:
- Combine rows from two related tables using different types of SQL JOINs
- Understand the differences between `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- Use joins to extract real-world data insights, even when some data is missing

Tools Used

-  MySQL Workbench
-  VS Code (with SQLTools)
-  DB Browser for SQLite *(LEFT JOIN supported only)*
