**Objective:**  
Learn how to extract and view specific data from a database using basic SQL SELECT queries.

## What I Learned

In this task, I explored how to:
- View entire tables or selected columns
- Filter data using conditions (`WHERE`)
- Sort results with `ORDER BY`
- Limit results using `LIMIT`

I now understand how to pull meaningful insights from a database, like:
- Which students are in Grade 10
- Which courses a teacher is handling
- The most recent enrollments

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- VS Code (with SQLTools)
- DB Browser for SQLite (optional)
